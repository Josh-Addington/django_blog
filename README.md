# django_blog

This a blogging platform that I created for myself using Django and PostGreSQL and deployed on Heroku.
The blog can be visited at [JoshAddington.com](www.joshaddington.com)

The blog app contains the Django project settings.

The blogging app contains the blog posts and root urls.

The projects app will handle the various data visualization projects that I'll be working on.
